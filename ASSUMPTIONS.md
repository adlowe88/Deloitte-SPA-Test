# Assumptions
- Only up to the first 5 rockets will be displayed, as I am yet to add pagination.
- Timezone: Sydney

# Still to do
- 1A: Add functionality to the header down chevron
- 2E: Invalid year range error
- 4D: All button links should open in a new tab.
- 5: Footer
- Loader when busy
- Style buttons, bottom of page, background color, etc.
- Keyword search case sensitvity (i.e. searching 'Falcon' vs. 'falcon)
- Add box shadow to Search Bar and Card List containers
- Accessability
- Better responsiveness
- Bug when filtered search should return all results, but returns one extra
- Check indentation
- Tests


# Changes to the starter project

[WHAT DID/WOULD YOU CHANGE, AND WHY]
- Add pagination of results, the design didn't account for displaying all the reuslts.
- 'Showing N of M Missions'
